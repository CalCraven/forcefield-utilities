# forcefield-utilities
This repository contains utility functions and classes necessary to convert forcefields from foyer to gmso.

## Warning
Fairly new package (i.e. experimental and can never manifest fully). Previously the plan was to contribute it as a PR to `gmso`. However, for testing and modular development (huge file changes, inherently buggy process), I chose this route.
